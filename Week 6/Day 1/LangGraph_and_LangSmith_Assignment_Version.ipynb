        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

It is used to ground the model on external sources of knowledge to supplement the model's internal representation of information.

            "Tool Response: The Machine learning-based attention method simulates how human attention works by assigning varying levels of importance to different words in a sentence. It assigns importance to each word by calculating \"soft\" weights for the word's numerical representation, known as its embedding, within a specific section of the sentence called the context window to determine its importance. The attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to increase model accuracy by focusing on relevant data. It enables the model to focus on certain areas of the input data, giving more weight to crucial features and disregarding unimportant ones.
